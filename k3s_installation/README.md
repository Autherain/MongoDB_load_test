## Installing k3s and kubectl
To install k3s and kubectl, you need to execute the script `install_k3s_and_kubectl.sh` on the master node.

Pay attention to the IP address you use to install k3s on the "workers" nodes.

I invite you to refer to the k3s documentation for more details at `https://docs.k3s.io/quick-start`.
